// TODO.dart - Comprehensive list of improvements and fixes needed

/*
=============================================================================
PRODUCTION FIXES NEEDED (Must fix before release)
=============================================================================

CRITICAL BUGS:
1. [FIXED] Scaffold.of() context issue causing bookmark crashes
2. [FIXED] RenderFlex overflow in settings speed selection  
3. [FIXED] Missing internet permissions in AndroidManifest - release builds can't access network
4. [FIXED] Incorrect juz page mappings - some juzs mapped to wrong pages
5. [FIXED] Dark mode SVG background color mismatch with app background

PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
1. [FIXED] Cache cleanup implemented - memory management working properly
2. [FIXED] Debug logging optimized - wrapped critical prints in kDebugMode
3. [VERIFIED] Widget rebuilds optimized - cache system prevents excessive rebuilds
4. [PENDING] Audio loading without timeout controls - can hang on slow networks

ERROR HANDLING:
1. [PENDING] Network request failures not handled properly in ayah_actions_sheet.dart
2. [PENDING] File loading failures not handled - JSON assets, corrupted files
3. [PENDING] SharedPreferences failures assumed to always succeed
4. [PENDING] Audio playback edge cases - no internet, corrupted files, permissions

UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
1. [PENDING] Hardcoded Arabic strings throughout codebase - need localization
2. [PENDING] Zoom function for accessibility (instead of screen reader support)
3. [PENDING] Inconsistent loading states across components  
4. [PENDING] Technical error messages shown to users instead of user-friendly ones
5. [PENDING] Missing input validation in jump-to-page dialog

CODE CLEANUP:
1. [PENDING] Magic numbers scattered everywhere - move to AppConstants
2. [PENDING] God classes - ViewerScreen (1271 lines), ContinuousAudioManager (820 lines)
3. [FIXED] Duplicate code - surah name mapping consolidated to SurahNames constants
4. [PENDING] Inconsistent state management - mix of setState, ValueNotifier, Provider
5. [FIXED] Unused imports and dead code removed, verbose comments cleaned
6. [PENDING] Inconsistent naming conventions
7. [PENDING] Missing documentation for complex logic

SECURITY:
1. [PENDING] Exposed API endpoints hardcoded in source code
2. [PENDING] No input sanitization for user input

=============================================================================
FUTURE FEATURES (After initial release)
=============================================================================

NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. [FUTURE] Download function for offline access
2. [FUTURE] Memorization helper with ayah repetition functionality
3. [FUTURE] Full internationalization support
4. [FUTURE] Advanced search functionality
5. [FUTURE] Reading progress tracking
6. [FUTURE] Custom recitation speed per surah

ADVANCED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. [FUTURE] Implement proper state management architecture (Riverpod/Bloc)
2. [FUTURE] Add comprehensive testing suite
3. [FUTURE] Implement CI/CD pipeline
4. [FUTURE] Add crash reporting and analytics
5. [FUTURE] Performance monitoring and optimization
6. [FUTURE] Advanced caching strategies
7. [FUTURE] Offline-first architecture
8. [FUTURE] Custom font loading and typography engine

=============================================================================
TECHNICAL DEBT:
=============================================================================

REFACTORING NEEDED:
1. [FUTURE] Split god classes into focused, single-responsibility classes
2. [FUTURE] Implement proper dependency injection
3. [FUTURE] Create abstract interfaces for better testability
4. [FUTURE] Standardize error handling patterns
5. [FUTURE] Implement proper logging framework
6. [FUTURE] Create design system documentation
7. [FUTURE] Add comprehensive code documentation

ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
1. [FUTURE] Implement clean architecture patterns
2. [FUTURE] Add proper abstraction layers
3. [FUTURE] Create domain models separate from UI models
4. [FUTURE] Implement repository pattern for data access
5. [FUTURE] Add use case classes for business logic

=============================================================================
NOTES:
=============================================================================

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix critical bugs that prevent app from working
2. Add missing network permissions and error handling  
3. Fix UI/UX issues that affect user experience
4. Clean up code and remove unused parts
5. Implement future features after core is stable

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
1. NEVER break existing working functionality
2. Always test changes thoroughly before committing
3. Double and triple check that edits improve without breaking
4. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
5. Add proper error handling for all new features
6. Document complex logic and decisions
7. Use meaningful variable and function names
8. Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility

TESTING CHECKLIST BEFORE EACH RELEASE:
- [ ] App launches without crashes
- [ ] All core features work (reading, audio, bookmarks, settings)
- [ ] Network access works in both debug and release builds  
- [ ] Dark/light theme switching works properly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on low-end devices
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended usage
- [ ] All user-facing errors have friendly messages
- [ ] Accessibility features work properly
